# ETT-LAPS

Welcome to Eli's Enterprise Tech Tool (ETT, for short). This is a spun-out repository that will be used for standalone development of the LAPS Application function!

_NOTE: ETT-LAPS is just a subset application for the full-fledged Eli's Enterprise Tech Toolkit. Changes here are far more delayed, and ETT as well has a ton of extra features, so definitely check out the full tool at [https://github.com/eliweitzman/EnterpriseTechTool](https://github.com/eliweitzman/EnterpriseTechTool)_
